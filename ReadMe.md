* Create a project

  -  _Add Images_ to the project by right-clicking the image pannel (upper right corner of the program) and choosing the folder containing the images.
 
* Reconstruction
  - *Runconstruct* -> *Image Matching*
  - *Runconstruct* -> *Run Sparse (SfM)* and wait to see the sparse point cloud.
  - *Runconstruct* -> *Run Dense (MVS)* and wait to see the dense point cloud.
